VLet my inspiration flow in token rhyme, suggesting rhythm,\u000aThat will not forsake me till my tale is told and done.\u000aWhile the firelight's aglow, strange shadows from the flames will grow,\u000aTill things we've never seen will seem familiar.\u000aShadows of a sailor forming winds both foul and fair all swarm.\u000aDown in Carlisle he loved a lady, many years ago.\u000aHere beside him stands a man, a soldier from the looks of him,\u000aWho came through many fights, but lost at love.\u000aWhile the story teller speaks, a door within the fire creaks,\u000aSuddenly flies open, and a girl is standing there.\u000aEyes alight, with glowing hair, all that fancy paints as fair,\u000aShe takes her fan and throws it, in the lion's den.\u000aWhich of you to gain me, tell, will risk uncertain pains of hell?\u000aI will not forgive you if you will not take the chance.\u000aThe sailor gave at least a try, the soldier being much too wise,\u000aStrategy was his strength, and not disaster.\u000aThe sailor, coming out again, the lady fairly leapt at him.\u000aThat's how it stands today, you decide if he was wise.\u000aThe storyteller makes no choice. soon you will not hear his voice.\u000aHis job is to shed light, and not to master.\u000aInspiration, move me brightly\u000alight the song with sense and color,\u000ahold away despair\u000aMore than this I will not ask\u000afaced with mysteries dark and vast\u000astatements just seem vain at last\u000asome rise, some fall, some climb\u000ato get to Terrapin\u000aCounting stars by candlelight\u000aall are dim but one is bright:\u000athe spiral light of Venus\u000arising first and shining best,\u000aFrom the northwest corner\u000aof a brand-new crescent moon\u000acrickets and cicadas sing\u000aa rare and different tune\u000aTerrapin Station\u000ain the shadow of the moon\u000aTerrapin Station\u000aand I know we'll be there soon\u000aTerrapin - I can't figure out\u000aTerrapin - if it's an end or the beginning\u000aTerrapin - but the train's got its brakes on\u000aand the whistle is screaming: TERRAPIN\u000aWhile you were gone\u000athese spaces filled with darkness\u000aThe obvious was hidden\u000aWith nothing to believe in\u000athe compass always points to Terrapin\u000aThe sullen wings of fortune beat like rain\u000aYou're back in Terrapin for good or ill again\u000aFor good or ill again
